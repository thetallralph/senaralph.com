I joined the company at an early stage as the first product designer in a very competitive market with big names like yotpo.com, smile.io, and Loyaltylion.

**Expanding the product**

When I joined, I helped expand the product from a simple Loyalty program plugin on Shopify to a full-fledged platform that included referral programs, notification widgets, social login, automated emails, and smart popups. My goal was to help create a comprehensive ecommerce platform so merchants could have everything they need to grow their business.

**Rebuilding for simplicity**

I felt like the product was becoming a jack of all trades and going a bit far from what made Beans special at the beginning: Simplicity. So I had to change my focus and totally rebuild the product for simplicity. I advocated for shutting down several features and simplifying (like really simplifying) the key flows.

**Scaling for enterprise**

Currently I'm working on scaling the product and reaching more enterprise customers. This brings its own set of product challenges, as I have to maintain simplicity while building for high-ticket customers.

**Leading the design team**

I manage a team of two junior designers and established an onboarding program to help new recruits integrate well into the design team and continuously grow and improve their skills.
