## Context

Two years ago, two Beninese residents in the United States approached me to design an application for sports coaches to manage all their students/clients. The main objective was to help them create a simple booking page and centralize their conversations and appointments with their students/clients.

## My Intervention

I helped them analyze the market, explore existing alternatives and potential direct competitors; based on this, I defined the product and established a market access strategy.

I then defined the scope of the MVP (minimum viable product); I started the design, which quickly gave me a basis for iteration, and I reached a version that seemed convincing to them.

I worked with the developer to review the design to make it easier and faster to implement. During this phase, I simplified certain processes to reach the market more quickly.
