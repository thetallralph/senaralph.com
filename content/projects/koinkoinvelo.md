## The Project

Koin Koin Vélo is my side entrepreneurial project where I'm exploring how to use knowledge from growing a digital product in the world of brick-and-mortar service companies. It's a bike rental and bike tour organization company that lets me explore marketing and entrepreneurship at a very small scale.
