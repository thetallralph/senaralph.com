## Context

I was early in my career and wanted to help the owner of a quiz product. I invited him to a restaurant to make a presentation. But opening a computer at a restaurant looked awkward visually for me. So I redesigned my pitch deck so it looks like playing card deck.

The metaphor behind was "I got the card of your success in my hand 🙂"

## The Physical Cards

Each slide was printed on cardboard in the usual size of playing cards. This entire set was then carefully stored in a box specially made for the occasion.
