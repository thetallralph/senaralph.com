## Context

This is where I've been working since 2019. The team is building the future of retention for ecommerce through rewards programs, referral programs and other features. I learned my real basics about product design with this product. I joined in a very competitive market with big names like yotpo.com, smile.io, and Loyaltylion. I joined the company at an early stage as the first product designer.

## My Work

- When I joined, I helped expand the product from a simple Loyalty program plugin on Shopify to a full-fledged platform that included referral programs, notification widgets, social login, automated emails, and smart popups. My goal was to help create a comprehensive ecommerce platform so merchants could have everything they need to grow their business.
- I felt like the product was becoming a jack of all trades and going a bit far from what made Beans special at the beginning: Simplicity. So I had to change my focus and totally rebuild the product for simplicity. I advocated for shutting down several features and simplifying (like really simplifying) the key flows.
- Currently I'm working on scaling the product and reaching more enterprise customers. This brings its own set of product challenges, as I have to maintain simplicity while building for high-ticket customers.
- I manage a team of two junior designers and established an onboarding program to help new recruits integrate well into the design team and continuously grow and improve their skills.

## Skills

- Building based on the UX of the merchant customer, not just on UI
- Keeping simplicity at the core of the UX for customers
- Product strategy to bring a feature from a customer pain to the product
- Rebuilding a big product from the ground up with a new vision
- Building low cost design - effective design that can be built very fast even by junior developers. This reduces the cost in time and money for implementation without impacting the product effectiveness and value for customers.
- To be honest, I owe how I envision a product today to this company and what I've been through here.
