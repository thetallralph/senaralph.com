A portfolio to show I can help you build a great product in 3 months or more 😉.
My name is Ralph and I am a product designer that like to build and make useful things.

It’s been a long time I did a portfolio. Mainly because I actually didn’t look for new freelance work for the few past years. Other than my main work, I worked for my own sideproject and a few other project from people that recommend me.  But it is clear that for you to select someone you want to do great work with, it is important to know what kind of work they might deliver. So I made a selection of few recent and old works to prove I have the skills and vibe to work part time with you.

Context

2 years ago, 2 benineses that was resident in the US, reached out to me to build an app for sport coaches so that they can manage all the client they are teaching too. The main objectives was to help  them create a simple booking page and handle their conversations and booking with their students/clients.


Work
- I help them analysing the current market, explore existing alternative and eventual direct competitors and based on that I define the product and put in place an strategy on how they could reach the market. 
- We then define what could be in their MVP and then I started working on the design and quickly we have something to iterate on and we quickly reach a version that sound interesting for them. 
- I started working with the developer so that we review the design in way so it is easy and fast to implement. During this phase I had to simplify certain process so we could reach market fast.

Here’s some of the design I gave them:

Skills
- A great collaboration with people that are new to the tech world
- Product strategy on what feature should ship first
- Product design to present a simple and easy to recognize app. A good app for pro but that have the friendly vibe of a consumer app

Context

This is the place I am working at since 2019. We are trying to build the future of retention for ecommerce through rewards program, referral program and other product/feature. I learned my real basics about product design through with this product. We are on a very competitive market where they were big name like yotpo.com, smile.io, Loyaltylion. I join the company at an early stage as the first product designer.


Work
- When I joined I help in expanding our product from a simple Loyalty program plugin on shopify to full fledge platform that did referral program, loyalty program, referral program, notification widget, social login, Automated emails and Smart popus.  We wanted to become a great ecommerce platform so merchant could have everything they need to grow their business
- We felt like we become a jack of all trade and went a bit far from what makes us Beans at the begining: Simplicity. So we have to change our focus recently and had to totally rebuild the product for simplicity, we shutdown several features, simplify (like really simplify) our key flows.
- Currently we are trying to scale our product and reach out to more and more enteprise customer. This brings its groups of product challenges, as we have to maintain simplicity while building for high ticket customer.

I made a selection of work that I can share:

Skills

- Building base on the UX of the merchant customer not just on UI
- Keep simplicity at the core of the UX for customers
- Product strategy to bring a feature from a customer pain to the product
- Rebuilding a big product from the ground up with a new vision
- Building low cost design. We give this name to effective design that can be built very fast even by junior dev. This reduce the cost in time an money for implementation without impacting the product effectiveness and value for our customers. 
- To be honest I own how I envision a product today because of this company and what we went through.

Ok good, you might tell yourself, this guy might know product a bit, but does he has a good visual taste and can make visually appealing work other than just design great UX flows. 
So in the following section, there is a selection of random works that showcase my visual creativity.


----------



Extérium (2017)

A friend you probably know was working on a game and I suggest some changes to make it more visually interesting.

Playing card like pitch deck (2018)

I didn’t built an UI on this project. It is a very old one and it is on this list because I find it quite creative. 
I was still early in my career and wanted to help the owner of a quizz product you probably know. I invite him in a restaurant to make a presentation. But opening a computer at a restaurant was looking awkward visually for me. So I redesign my pitch deck so it looks like playing card deck. 
The metaphor behind was “I got the card of your success in my find 🙂”

The physical cards
Chacune des slides a été imprimée sur du papier carton en fonction de la taille habituelle des cartes de jeux. Tout cet ensemble a ensuite été soigneusement rangé dans une boîte spécialement réalisé pour l’occasion

Other skills that could be interesting…

Other than those projects I like side projects. They help me explore try new skills that can make me better designer.
I am currently experimenting the possibility how to apply the way we lead a product company in or to build a brick-and-mortar bike business: koinkoinvelo.com. With this side project I am learning marketing and a bit of coding (with svelte). 
Talking about Svelte, 1,5 years ago after being frustrated while building a website with Wordpress and Elementor I rebuilt in Svelte: https://www.togunaworld.com/. It was an interesting project.
